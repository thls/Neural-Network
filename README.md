# Neural-Network
 Repository created in order to practice neural network fundamentals and concepts using a few programming languages such as node.js, typescript and angular.
 
 ## Presentation
Hey! This project has been created in order to practice some concepts about neural networks and learn a few programming languages at the same time. Also I'm improving my english writing I hope you don't mind if I make any mistake. 

I will organize the content in folders which will have a README file explaining something about the subject. So far I want to practice some subjects like backpropagation, convolutional neural networks, genetic algorithm applied to neural networks and more. Obviously, every subject that I'm learning I will put on here.
